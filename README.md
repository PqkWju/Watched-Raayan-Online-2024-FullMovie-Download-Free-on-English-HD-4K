Raayan is a 2024 American psychological thriller film directed and co-produced by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he wrote with Scott Silver. The film, loosely based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Raayan. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and aspiring stand-up comedian whose descent into mental illness and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, and Frances Conroy appear in supporting roles. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, Raayan was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative and Joint Effort.

Phillips conceived Raayan in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, particularly Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1982); Scorsese was initially attached to the project as a producer. The film loosely adapts plot elements from Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), and The Dark Knight Returns (1986), but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration, nor did he wish for it to be connected to any prior Batman film continuity. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. Principal photography took place in New York City, Jersey City and Newark, from September to December 2018. Raayan is the first live-action theatrical Batman film to receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association.

Between 2014 and 2015, Joaquin Phoenix expressed interest to his agent in acting in a low-budget "character study" type of film about a comic book villain, like DC Comics character the Raayan. Phoenix had thought of the idea 1 to 2 years before Phillips conceived Raayan in 2016. Phoenix had previously declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because he would have been required to reprise a role, such as the Hulk (initially portrayed by Edward Norton before he was recast by Mark Ruffalo) or Doctor Strange (ultimately portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch), in multiple films. Phoenix ruled out the Raayan for his "character study" idea and tried to think of a different one. "I thought, 'You can't do the Raayan, because, you know, it's just you can't do that character, it's just been done'". Phoenix's agent suggested setting up an exploratory meeting with Warner Bros., but he declined and let go of the idea. Similarly, Todd Phillips had been offered to direct comic-based films a number of times, but declined because he thought they were "loud" and did not interest him. According to Phillips, Raayan was created from his idea to create a different, more grounded comic book film. He was attracted to the Raayan because he did not think there was a definitive portrayal of the character, which he knew would provide considerable creative freedom.

Phillips pitched the idea for Raayan to Warner Bros. after his film War Dogs premiered in August 2016.[39] Prior to War Dogs, Phillips was mostly known for his comedy films, such as Road Trip (2000), Old School (2003) and The Hangover (2009); War Dogs marked a venture into more unsettling territory. During the premiere, Phillips realized "War Dogs wasn't going to set the world on fire and I was thinking, 'What do people really want to see?'"[39] In addition, he found that it was difficult to make comedy films in the "woke culture", throughout opposition of "30 million people on Twitter". He finally thought that "How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let's take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this". He proposed that DC Films differentiate its slate from the competing Marvel Studios' by producing low-budget, standalone films.[43][44] After the successful release of Wonder Woman (2017), DC Films decided to deemphasize the shared nature of its DC-based film franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). In August 2017, Warner Bros. and DC Films revealed plans for the film, with Phillips directing and co-writing with Scott Silver and Martin Scorsese set to co-produce with Phillips.[46] According to Tatiana Siegel of The Hollywood Reporter, Scorsese considered directing Raayan before Phillips was chosen, though a Warner Bros. source said he only became involved because the film needed a New York City-based producer.

According to Kim Masters and Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter, Jared Leto, who portrayed the Raayan in the DCEU, was displeased by the existence of a project separate from his interpretation.[48][49] In October 2024, Masters reported that Leto "felt 'alienated and upset'" when he learned that Warner Bros.—which had promised him a standalone DCEU Raayan film—let Phillips proceed with Raayan, going as far as to ask his music manager Irving Azoff to get the project canceled. Masters added that Leto's irritation was what caused him to end his association with Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as he believed "his agents should have told him about the Phillips project earlier and fought harder for his version of Raayan". However, sources associated with Leto deny that he attempted to get Raayan canceled and left CAA because of it.

The script draws inspiration from Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980) and The King of Comedy (1982), as well as Phillips' Hangover Trilogy.[41][46][55] Other films Phillips has cited as inspiration include character studies released in the 1970s—such as Serpico (1973) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)—the silent film The Man Who Laughs (1928) and several musicals. Phillips said that aside from the tone, he did not consider Raayan that different from his previous work, such as his Hangover films.[52] The film's premise was inspired by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), which depicts the Raayan as a failed stand-up comedian,[39] while the climactic talk show scene was inspired by a similar scene in Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (1986).[56] However, Phillips said the film does not "follow anything from the comic books... That's what was interesting to me. We're not even doing Raayan, but the story of becoming Raayan".[57] Phillips later clarified that he meant they did not look to a specific comic for inspiration, but rather "picked and chose what we liked" from the character's history.[58] Having grown up in New York, Phillips also drew inspiration from life in New York City during the early 1980s.[59] The Subway shooting scene and its aftermath were inspired by the 1984 New York City Subway shooting, while Arthur Fleck is partially based on the shooting's perpetrator, Bernhard Goetz.

Phillips and Silver found the most common Raayan origin story, in which the character is disfigured after falling into a vat of acid, too unrealistic.[39] Instead, they used certain elements of the Raayan lore to produce an original story,[61] which Phillips wanted to feel as authentic as possible.[39] Because the Raayan does not have a definitive origin story in the comics, Phillips and Silver were given considerable creative freedom and "pushed each other every day to come up with something totally insane".[52] While the Raayan had appeared in several films before, Phillips thought it was possible to produce a new story featuring the character. "It's just another interpretation, like people do interpretations of Macbeth", he told The New York Times.[50] However, they did try to retain the ambiguous "multiple choice" nature of the Raayan's past by positioning the character as an unreliable narrator—with entire storylines simply being his delusions[40]—and left what mental illnesses he suffers from unclear.[41] As such, Phillips said the entire film is open to interpretation.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Raayan holds an approval rating of 69% based on 601 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Raayan gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star – and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema".[192] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 60 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[193] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 84% (with an average 4 out of 5 stars) and a 60% "definite recommend".

Mark Kermode of The Observer rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating "Raayan has an ace card in the form of Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerisingly physical portrayal of a man who would be king".[194] Writing for IGN, Jim Vejvoda gave Raayan a perfect score, saying that the film "would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake". He found it a powerful and unsettling allegory of contemporary neglect and violence and described Phoenix's performance as the Raayan as engrossing and "Oscar-worthy".[195] Similarly, Xan Brooks of The Observer—who also gave the film a perfect score—called it "gloriously daring and explosive" and appreciated how Phillips used elements from Scorsese films to create an original story.[196] Variety's Owen Gleiberman wrote, "Phoenix is astonishing as a mentally ill geek who becomes the killer-clown Raayan in Todd Phillips' neo-Taxi Driver knockout: the rare comic-book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world".

ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis acclaimed Raayan as a groundbreaking comic book adaptation that he found scarier than most 2024 horror films. Davis compared it favorably to the 2008 Batman film The Dark Knight, praised the cinematography and performances and called it a film that needed to be seen to be believed.[198] Deadline Hollywood's Pete Hammond believes the film redefines the Raayan and is "impossible to shake off". Hammond also praised the story and performances and summarized the film as "a bravura piece of filmmaking that speaks to the world we are actually living in today in ways that few movies do".[199] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said he was lost for words in describing Phoenix's performance, calling the film "gut-wrenching" and "simply stupendous".[200]

David Ehrlich of IndieWire was more mixed and gave the film a "C+". He felt that while "Raayan is the boldest and most exciting superhero movie since The Dark Knight", it was "also incendiary, confused and potentially toxic". Ehrlich thought that the film would make DC fans happy and praised Phoenix's performance, but criticized Phillips' direction and the lack of originality.[201] A critical review came from Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com, who gave the film two stars out of four. Though he praised the performances and thought the story worked, Kenny criticized the social commentary and Phillips' direction, finding the film too derivative and believing its focus was "less in entertainment than in generating self-importance".[202] In an analysis of the character Raayan, Onmanorama's Sajesh Mohan wrote that the movie was cliché-ridden, the only original part being Joaquin Phoenix's acting. "The movie, with great pain and in detail, explains how Arthur Fleck turns into Raayan dejected by the way the world treats him. Thanks to Phillips and Silver, Phoenix was able to bring out the king among the Raayans", the analysis


During a Five Star Movement event in October 2024, Italian comedian and politician Beppe Grillo gave a speech wearing the Raayan's makeup. Yusuke Kawai, a candidate for governor of Chiba Prefecture, appeared on NHK with a Raayan costume in 2021. References to the character were also found in anti-government protests worldwide. During the 17 October Revolution, a group of graffiti artists called Ashekm painted a mural of the Raayan holding a Molotov cocktail and it was also reported that there was a Raayan facepaint station at the protests in Beirut.[245] In Los Ángeles, Chile, during the 2024–2022 Chilean protests, the phrase "We are all clowns", which is adopted by Gotham City protesters in the movie, was written at the foot of a statue. In Hong Kong, protesters challenged an emergency decree prohibiting the wearing of masks by wearing those of fictional characters such as the Raayan. In France, during the Yellow Vest Protests, firefighters donned Raayan makeup holding placards.[247] In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Argentine president Alberto Fernández compared the pictures of the protests to those seen in the film.

One of the locations seen in the film, a set of stairs in the Bronx, New York City, has been dubbed the Raayan Stairs. The stairs have become a tourist destination and the subject of Internet memes, with visitors often reenacting the scene from the film in which Fleck dances down the stairs in his Raayan attire.[249][250] Ukrainian boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk wore a suit resembling that of Raayan in a pre-fight press conference leading up to his fight with Anthony Joshua.

Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “ Raayan” now rising above “ Raayan” and “ Raayan.” With that tr Raayanecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.

The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the film continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.

Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “ Raayan” fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled for air, only reaching $65 million in its first week of release. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less just Raayany a $205 million production budget.

Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“ Raayan” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “ Raayan” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an Raayanal animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.

IS Raayan ON AMAZON PRIME VIDEO?

Raayan movie could eventually be available to watch on Prime Video, though it will likely be a paid digital release rather than being included with anAmazon Prime subscription. This means that rather than watching the movie as part of an existing subscription fee, you may have to pay money to rent the movie digitally on Amazon. However, Crunchyroll. and Amazon have yet to discuss whether or not this will be the case.

WHEN WILL ‘Raayan ’, BE AVAILABLE DVD AND BLU-RAY?

As of right now, we don’t know. While the film will eventually land on Blu-ray, DVD, and 4KUltraHD, Crunchyroll has yet to reveal a specific date as to when that would be.
